## Thanks

This collection could not have been made possible without the help of the following resources:
* [TeXample](http://www.texample.net); the figures from here often provide a solid starting point.
* [LaTeX Stack Exchange](http://tex.stackexchange.com); threads from here are typically the first results that pop up when googling for a particular technique/problem.
* [A GitHub Repository](https://github.com/PetarV-/TikZ) For the basics of the deep learning techniques
